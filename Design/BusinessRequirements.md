## Business Requirements

### Bulk Sign Up
- The system must support the bulk sign-up of users. Currently, the manual, one-by-one entry of user information is time-consuming. It should handle the registration of large groups, accommodating 5, 10, 100, or more advisors in a single sign-up.

### Unified Subscription View
- Users must be able to view and manage all their Moneytree subscriptions in one centralized location. This aims to enhance the user experience by consolidating subscription data and making it easily accessible.

### Subscription Modification
- Users must have the flexibility to modify their subscription details. Currently, there is no streamlined way to do this. Whether they need to upgrade, add another service, or make other adjustments, users should find this process easy to do.
