## Business Requirements

### Bulk Sign Up
- There needs to be a way to sign up multiple advisors at one time. Currently, the manual, one-by-one entry of user information is time-consuming. It should handle the registration of large groups, accommodating up to 20 advisors. By implementing this, it solves the goal of a quick way to sign up mid size companies in a streamlined way.

### Unified Subscription View
- Users must be able to view and manage all their Moneytree subscriptions in one centralized location. This aims to enhance the user experience by consolidating subscription data and making it easily accessible. This solves the goal of creating an interface which shows only necessary information from Maxio to the user, rather than the entirety of provided information from Maxio.

### Subscription Modification
- Users must have the flexibility to modify their subscription details. Currently, there is no simple way to do this. Whether they need to upgrade, add another service, or make other adjustments, users should find this process easy to do. This solves the goal of creating a way for users to modify their subscriptions on their own, in a few simple steps.
