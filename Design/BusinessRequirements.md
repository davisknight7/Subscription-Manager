## Business Requirements

### Bulk Sign Up
- The system must support the bulk sign-up of users. Currently, the manual, one-by-one entry of user information is time-consuming. It should handle the registration of large groups, accommodating 5, 10, 100, or more advisors in a single sign-up.

### Unified Subscription View
- Users must be able to view and manage all their Moneytree subscriptions in one centralized location. This aims to enhance the user experience by consolidating subscription data and making it easily accessible.

### Subscription Modification
- Users must have the flexibility to modify their subscription details. Currently, there is no streamlined way to do this. Whether they need to upgrade, add another service, or make other adjustments, users should find this process easy to do.

### Premium Services Integration
- The platform should allow users to add premium services to their existing subscriptions. This is an important functionality because it is a source of revenue for Moneytree.

### External Systems Integration
- Any changes made by users within the platform should be synchronized with external systems like Maxio and HubSpot. This is needed to maintain data consistency across different systems.

### User Profile Management
- Users must be able to view and edit their personal details, including payment methods. This is to ensure that users can maintain up-to-date records.

### Enhanced Security
- Given the sensitive nature of subscription and payment data, the platform should prioritize data security and protection measures. As well as reducing payment complexities, to avoid security issues.

### Intuitive User Experience
- The interface of the platform should be user-friendly, facilitating easy navigation and ensuring a seamless user experience. This will be similar to the Maxio Billing Dashboard to keep it familiar to existing users, but also streamlining many of the pain points the Maxio Billing Dashboard currently has.
