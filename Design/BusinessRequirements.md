## Business Requirements

### Bulk Sign Up
* The business requirement is bulk sign up of users because currently they have to put in each users information one at a time. This is a time consuming process and can be automated. This is a key feature of their new platform and progresses them towards their goal of letting users manage their subscriptions in one place. 
### API Integration
* Create an api that gets their current user/subscription information from maxio and hubspot.

### Subscription Management
* Right now users have no way to view all of their Moneytree subscriptions in one place.
