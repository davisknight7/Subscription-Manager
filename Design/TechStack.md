## Tech Stack

1. **Front End**
    - Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/), a Javascript framework used for building user interfaces. Used for building modern web applications. This will be used for subscription managing in order to sign up as many advisors as desired at once via the web. This was chose for our tech stack simply because the client request that we use it in the project.
  
    - Possible Libraries: Element UI, Vue Router, Vuex, Vuetify, etc. 

2. **Back End**
    - .NET (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), supports several langauges, we will use C#. We chose this for our tech stack because the client requested that we use it in the project. 

3. **Database**
    - PostgreSQL. (https://www.postgresql.org/). The client requested that we either use Microsoft SQL Server, or PostgreSQL. After some research on the pros and cons of each, we are choosing to PostgreSQL.
