# Subscription Manager Dashboard

## Step 1:

- You will begin in the main dashboard for the Subscription Manager
- It should look something like this:
  ![Dash Step 1-1](./images/step1-main-dashboard.png)
- Depending on what subscriptions the customer is signed in under, different information may show or the layout/colors may differ slightly
- All different functionality options are available on this single dashboard

## Step 2:
- You can view subscription information in the subscription card at the top of the dashboard, here:
  ![Dash Step 2-1](./images/step2-subscription-card.png)

## Step 3:
- In the customer information tab, you can view your personal information on your account. It looks like this, notice the edit button in the top right: 
  ![Dash Step 3-1](./images/step3-customer-info.png)
- Clicking the edit button in the top right will bring up a modal. Here you can edit your personal information. Clicking the submit button will send the request to Maxio to update the information. Simply fill out the fields, and click submit, or click close to close the modal. It looks like this:
  ![Dash Step 3-2](./images/step3-customer-info-modal.png)

## Step 4:
- This chart is a chart that represents invoice subtotal amounts throughout the history of the account. It simply provides a more easily understandable view of this information for the customer. It looks like this:
  ![Dash Step 4-1](./images/step4-invoice-chart.png)

## Step 5:
- Inside the tab switcher lives 2 sections, the billing section and invoices section.
- It starts on the billing tab, or you can return to it by clicking the billing tab again. You will see your personal billing information, including a masked card number. It will look like this, notice the edit button in the top right:
  ![Dash Step 5-1](./images/step5-billing-tab.png)
- Clicking the edit button will bring up a modal. Similar to the customer information modal, you can input new billing information and submit it, or close the modal using the corresponding buttons. It looks like this:
  ![Dash Step 5-2](./images/step5-billing-tab-modal.png)

## Step 6:
- Clicking on Invoices will take you to the invoice table inside the invoice tab. It looks like this, notice the links and page numbers:
  ![Dash Step 6-1](./images/step6-invoice-table.png)
- Each page of the table includes up to 10 invoices. Buttons are disabled accordingly. In this instance, there are less than 10 invoices so all the buttons are disabled. If there were, say 15 invoices, there would be 2 page buttons plus 'prev' and 'next', and when on the initial page 1, the 'prev' button and '1' would be disabled.
- Clicking the invoice number link brings up a modal. This modal can include just a public url to the invoice, where it can be paid. It will only show a url if the invoice is a singular invoice, without any child segments. If the invoice is a parent invoice, i.e. they have child segments, a table will be inside the modal as well, showing those children segments. The modal can be closed using the 'close' button. It looks like this (this is a parent invoice with children segments):
  ![Dash Step 6-1](./images/step6-invoice-table-modal.png)

# Onboarding
## Step 1:
- You will start on an account creation page. Enter the information asked for, there is validation for what is reuired. It looks like this (with validation errors), notice the steps at the top, and the 'next' button at the bottom:
  ![Onboarding Step 1-1](./images/step1-onboarding-account-creation.png)
- The steps at the top track your progress through the initial onboarding process, and the 'next' button takes you to the next step, as long as validation is met in the form.

## Step 2:
- You just click through each step, filling out requested information. The next step looks like this:
  ![Onboarding Step 1-1](./images/step1-onboarding-profile-setup.png)
- Steps will look similar to these listed above.
- The 'previous' button takes you to the previous step.

## Step 3:
- The last step will have a submit button, currently there is no functionality to this:
