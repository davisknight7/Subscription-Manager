## Topics Discussed
- This was the second meeting of the 5th iteration
- The topics discussed in this meeting included: The overall state of the Dashboard, the various features for each project, and the future of the iteration/finalization of the project.
- We first walked through the dashboard. It was very repetitive from the last iteration, since there was only large new feature there, others were some QOL changes and bug fixes.
- The important feature was Subscription Group Overview, which is a brand new tab which displays a customer's subscription group and its relevant members + metadata.
- We then went through various the various bug fixes that are done, and the QOL adjustments like keyboard shortcuts.
- We then discussed onboarding backend adjustments
- After all that, we just kind of talked about wrapping up the iteration and testing

## Things Clarified
- Evan said the Subscription Group Overview looks awesome and thinks Nathan will really like it our front end changes for it
- Evan said that we have done a great job on the project this year
- Most of our features this iteration were just extra additions not initially planned by the client, so Evan said it is not a big deal if we leave a couple of the recommendations out, since they were last minute anways
- Evan said the dashboard chart changes were nice
- Evan said that the onboarding form will be a good start on the project when transferred over
- Overall, Evan said great job
