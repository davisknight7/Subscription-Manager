## Topics Discussed

- The topics discussed in this meeting were: resolve promises for our invoice api calls, our new multi dashboard/vite project setup, icons, and subscription groups
- We are having trouble with resolve promises correctly in order to show all of the results from the invoice api calls. Evan helped with this
- We showed off the multi dashboard setup he has been working on to allow for separate dashboards for products, but also shared components between them
- We asked where they currently get icons from, so we can stay consistent
- We discussed subscription groups for payments once again, and talked about how that may potentially affect bulk signup

## Things Clarified

- Evan said we are making good progress
- Evan clarified/explained how to deal with multiple promises. He showed how you can make a list of promises and wait until they are resolvd. Also, do not await an already async call.
- Evan thought our idea for multi-dashboards was a cool solution
- Evan clarified that the icons Moneytree currently uses are Google Font Material Symbols and Icons
- Evan said that our questions about payment groups are better suited for Nathan, but he wrote them down to ask for us, before the next client meeting. That way Nathan could prepare an answer for us.
