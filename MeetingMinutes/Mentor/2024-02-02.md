## Topics Discussed
- The topics discussed in this meeting were: An overview of our iteration 3 features, testing, bugs, and the 4th iteration
- We walked Evan through our main features for this iteration: invoices, billing editing and multi dashboards
- Through discussion about invoices we discussed an issue/bug we were having with the child invoice list inside a popup modal showout ing
- We showed off pagination and discussed potential for adding a spinner when paginating
- We asked Evan about testing, specifically the front end, and also viewing coverage
- We discussed the potential features brought up for iteration 4 briefly


## Things Clarified 
- Evan said we are doing a great job and that invoices looks good
- Evan said that he thinks that our mutli dashboard setup looks nice, and agrees that it will be super nice when editing dashboards in the future, since you can just drop components ittle into each dashboard
- Evan asked us about our ability to generate the URL to edit payment, and we kind of discussed the best option, an external link, or in app editing
- Evan helped a little with potential fixes for the invoice bug
- Evan said that during his capstone they used Jest to test the front end
- During our discussion about the next iteration, we discussed the potential for introducing a database
- Evan wasn't super sure whether or not we would need it, he said we would probably need more information from Nathan first
