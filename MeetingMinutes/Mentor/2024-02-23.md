## Topics Discussed
- The topics discussed in this meeting were: The modal component, the editing billing/information component(s), and Maxio API
- We spent some time showing our new components, which one was the new generic modal component
- Another component was the edit info/billing component. We were having some issues with this, so Evan helped us through some solutions
- We discussed updates to the layout as well.
- We discussed Maxio Api respones related to billing, and potential rewrites for our API
- We discussed the Maxio SDK


## Things Clarified 
- Evan said our layout changes look good
- Evan said if our API is working fine for us, it may not be worth sacrificing functionality for backend rewrites
- Evan helped on some bugs we were having with vue component props
- Evan said our modal component was nice, since it is generic
- Evan helped with a generic edit info component, and showed us some fixes
- Evan explained giving a generic type to an object passed as a Vue prop
