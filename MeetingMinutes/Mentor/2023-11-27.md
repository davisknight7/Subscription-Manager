## Topics Discussed

- The topics in this meeting were Docker and our subscription manager dashboard/the api for it.
- First off, we showed off our Docker and that it runs successfully.
- We made the point to show that it runs two front ends, one for our bulk signup, and one for our subscription manager dashboard. It also runs our api backend.
- We discussed our front end and described our plan for the rest of the iteration for approaching the tasks distributed for it.
- Specifically, we showed that we had it sectioned off currently, so people could easily take parts to work on.

## Things Clarified

- Evan said we had made good progress.
- We talked with Evan about Docker a bit, nothing super specific clarified, just a discussion.
- Evan clarified that what we need to do with Hubspot is being discussed.
- Evan clarified that there should be a decision made on that by the next client meeting, or the one after.
- We proposed that we could push Hubspot off to the next iteration, Evan said that sounded like a good idea.
- Evan clarified that our plan for the rest of the iteration sounded good.
