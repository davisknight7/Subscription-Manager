## Things Clarified

- We clarified the remaining tasks for the week, specifically pertaining to the code and our end functionality for this iteration
- We clarified what needs to be done, pertaining to the assignments and required meetings for the rest of the iteration
- We clarified what could be done AFTER the remaining tasks for the iteration are completed
- We clarified that we should move our client meeting for the week to be closer to the iteration due date, so we can show off our features

## Topics Discussed

- The discussion for this week was almost completeley related to code, mainly bugs, finishing features, and tests
- We discussed with Connor what else he should be testing, as well as different front end tasks that he could complete in the mean time
- We discussed the submit button with Evyn as he needed some help with that
- Davis needed help fully understanding what our endpoint should do, so Drew and Davis worked on that and discussed for a bit
- We also briefly discussed potential things to show to the client for the week, and ultimately decided to hold off on meeting with them until the iteration meeting

## Tasks distributed

- Davis will continue work on the back end, and ultimately get the submitted form information to successfully create a subscription on Maxio's end, using the test api key
- Drew will continue work on the back end as well, focusing on the Maxio service, and diving more into the Maxio documentation to make sure we are not missing something important
- Evyn will continue work on the submit button, and then take some of the remaining bugs and styling updates we have listed out for the iteration in our discord
- Connor will continue working on unit tests, and also take some of the small bugs and styling updates we have listed in our discord
- Conner is running into a few bugs related to our advisor modal, specifically when editing. He will continue working on this to make sure it is smooth for our iteration demo
