## Things Clarified

- We clarified what issues were still existing which prevent us from our final goals for the iteration.
- We clarified what each of us had been working on the last couple of days since our last team meeting
- We clarified what each of us would work on during this meeting

## Progress made
- Conner was having a bug with his edit functionality on the advisor modal, so him and Drew spent some time working on it and ultimately a reasonable solution was found for now
- Evyn got his submit button nearly complete
- Drew helped everyone progress on the bugs they had
- Davis and Connor worked on their tasks
- There were issues with our C# model for the http request, mainly that properties of the model were not being assigned and left either empty or null. Davis and Drew worked on this and some of the issues were resolved, but ultimately there is still a property which is null for some reason.
