## Topics Discussed
During this meeting we mainly went over what needs to be done by October 11th. After that, we worked on listing out and describing the business requirements for the project.

## Things Clarified
Meeting frequency and mediums: We are planning to meet in person at least once a week, and utilize Discord for as many virtual meetings as needed throughout the weeks.<br>
Client meetings: We need to meet at least twice before our design presentation in class.

## Tasks Distributed
We sort of went through the tasks due on the 11th to distribute them out, but realized many of them should be done together, so no real distribution happened. It ended up being something like, "if you think you can make some progress on a task before our next meeting, go ahead and do it." Ultimately, it still helped to clarify our next steps.<br>
