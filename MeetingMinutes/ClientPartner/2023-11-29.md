## Topics Discussed

- This meeting was just a catchup meeting during the iteration, nothing specific, just to update the client
- We first discussed our new API endpoint and what information was being pulled and how we pulled that
- We then showed off and discused our basic layout for the frontend of the subscription manager dashboard
- We discussed the bugs we had been working on 
- We discussed the billing information section for a little since that is a key feature being asked for the billing dashboard

## Things Clarified

- Nathan clarified that we may not be able to use customer ID like we are currently doing to get subscription information. Instead we probably need to use the license key to get a customer's subscription ids which will then get us that information
- The client's clarified that our current basic layout was a good start and can see where it is going from there
- The client claririfed editing that payment info is going to potentially be a difficult task, since we are going to have to get that through to Maxio's side
- The client clarified that we do not need to worry about Hubspot for this project, as that would probably only introduce issues that would hold our progress elsewhere
