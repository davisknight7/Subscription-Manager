## Topics Discussed
- This meeting involved our iteration 3 progresions, and a brief discussion of what is to come in the next iteration
- We first showed off invoice viewing, how all of the invoice data is shown for the customers various payments, and also the status colors + pagination
- We then showed off the invoice modal which includes the link to the public invoice, which allows the user to pay their invoice or view the payment
- We then showed off our multiple product dashboards, one for each core product
- We gave an example how our component library can easily be used as a plug and play for creating new dashboards/updating them
- We then showed off our billing section and that it now repopulates the user's payment information
- We discussed the next iteration's customer information page, including how it should look and where it should be in the dashboard
- We slightly discussed the onboarding project as well
- We also discussed potential for updating the layout of the subscription manager dashboard

## Things Clarified
- There was a question about child segments that we had, and Nathan clarified it is probably a Maxio issue that customers wouldn't likely run into, but its still a good idea to take it into consideration
- Nathan clarified that billing updating should be done inside the app if possible, for next iteration
- Nathan clarified that we should just make sure it is obvious that the dashboard being used differs from other Product dashboards for now
- Nathan clarified that the info gathered from the onboarding project can be saved using Maxio metadata
- Nathan clarified that we should limit external links from the subscription manager wherever possible, excluding the public invoice URL

## Feedback
- Our subscription manager dashboard looks great, but we can explore options for an updated layout
- Ideally we do not want to take the user outside of the dashboard
- Make it clear enough that the product dashboards are different for each product, including colors + wording
- We are doing good work, keep it up.
