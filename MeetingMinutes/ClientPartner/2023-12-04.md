## Topics Discussed

- This meeting involved a lot of different discussions based around the future of the project, but also involved showing off our progress to the client, for this iteration
- We started off by showing off the new additional products/component support for bulk signup, and that it was reflected in Maxio
- We then transitioned to showing off our subscription manager dashboard, which we used the ids generated from our bulk signup example to populate
- This showed that additional products did attach to the core product subscription and displayed properly from the API
- The main functionality we shocased was that additional product support, as well as the dashboard being used to retrieve data, as long as a customer ID is provided
- The discussion then went to the questions we had thought of while working on this project
- One question was about payment methods. This was a big deal since editiability of payment info is a key feature the client is asking for in the subscription manager dasboard, this sparked a large discussion
- Another question was about what information we should show on the dashboard, as we just pulled what makes sense for now
- Another question was about the amount of core products a customer can have, which sparked a large discussion as well

## Things Clarified
- It was clarified that our subscription manager dashboard is looking great
- Other than just pulling whatever info seems revelant, Nathan clarified that we should show invoice history on the dashboard
- Nathan clarified that our bulk signup was good as is when it coems to supporting multiple core products
- There was really no clarification on what we should do about the payment editing. Since bulk signup copies payment info, we need to figure out how payment edits should be reflected across all of the users.
- What was clarified was that Nathan would bring this up with Patrick and get us some clarifications on that in the next meeting
- It was clarified by Nathan that customers do commonly have both the products 'Advise' and 'Plan". However, these subscriptions are treated separately, and with how their app is currently setup, the dashboard would not show both types of products in the same dashboard. They would need to show separately, under an 'Advise' dashboard and a 'Plan' dashboard.
- Other than clarifications about our questions, Nathan clarified that our subscription manaager definitely was going in the right direction, and bulk signup is "perfect as is"
