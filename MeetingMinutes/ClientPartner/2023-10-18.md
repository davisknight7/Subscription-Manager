## Topics Discussed

- We discussed our design items a little bit further, including feedback we received from Ergin on them.
- We asked our client a few more questions about our front end design, mainly focusing on what fields are actually required, product selection, and multiple payment methods.
- We also biefly discussed what we should be saving on our end and what is not necessary.

## Things Clarified

- There are actually very few required fields when it comes to creating a new subscription. Nathan walked us through creating a subscription in Maxio and showed just how many fields are actually optional, and explained we will not need nearly that many when we create their bulk signup.
- There was some clarification regarding payment methods, such as including an "add billing method" option for when an account manager wants to apply multiple credit cards. This needs further clarification, as we were previously underr the assumption that only one payment method needed to be handleded for this project, and any more would need to be taken up with Moneytree support.
- Email address doubles as a license key.
