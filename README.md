# Subscription-Manager

## **Summary**

This project contains two parts. The first part is implementing a way for bulk signing up users for moneytree. Currently, only one advisor can be signed up at a time. Ideally, it should be easy to sign up as many advisors as desired at a time, which will help Moneytree as it scales. The second part is creating a subscription management interface that allows the user to easily manage their moneytree subscription.
